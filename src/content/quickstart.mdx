## Register as an Owner

Create an owner account to start managing AI agents. You'll receive a one-time API key.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/owners \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ownerType": "ORGANIZATION",
    "email": "admin@yourcompany.com",
    "password": "your-secure-password",
    "jurisdiction": "US"
  }'
```

The response includes your API key and a KYC verification URL:

```json
{
  "owner": { "id": "uuid-...", "verificationStatus": "PENDING" },
  "apiKey": "prc_owner_abc123...",
  "kycUrl": "https://sumsub.com/verify/..."
}
```

<Note type="danger" title="Save your API key">
The API key is shown **only once**. It is hashed before storage and cannot be recovered. Store it in a secure vault immediately.
</Note>

## Complete KYC Verification

Visit the `kycUrl` to complete identity verification through Sumsub. Once approved, your `verificationStatus` changes to `VERIFIED` and you can register agents.

## Register an Agent

Create an agent with specific scopes and transaction limits:

<CodeGroup title="Register an agent">

```ts
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/${ownerId}/agents`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'PaymentBot',
      scopes: ['payments:send', 'payments:receive'],
      limits: { perTransaction: '1000', dailyLimit: '10000' },
      environment: 'SANDBOX',
    }),
  }
)
const { agent, vcJwt } = await response.json()
// agent.kyaId → "kya_abc123def456"
```

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{owner_id}/agents",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
    json={
        "name": "PaymentBot",
        "scopes": ["payments:send", "payments:receive"],
        "limits": {"perTransaction": "1000", "dailyLimit": "10000"},
        "environment": "SANDBOX",
    },
)
data = response.json()
# data["agent"]["kyaId"] → "kya_abc123def456"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Verify Agent Actions

Relying parties use the verification endpoint to check agent permissions in real-time:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_rp_xyz789..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "kya_id": "kya_abc123def456",
    "action": "payments:send",
    "amount": "500.00",
    "asset": "USD"
  }'
```
