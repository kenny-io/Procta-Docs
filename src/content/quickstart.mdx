This guide gets you from zero to verifying agent actions in production. You'll register as a relying party, get an API key, and make your first verification call.

## 1. Register as a Relying Party

Create a relying party account to get your API key:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/relying-parties \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "YourPlatform",
    "contactEmail": "integrations@yourplatform.com",
    "password": "your-secure-password"
  }'
```

```json
{
  "relyingParty": { "id": "uuid-...", "name": "YourPlatform" },
  "apiKey": "prc_rp_xyz789..."
}
```

<Note type="danger" title="Save your API key">
The API key is shown **only once**. It is hashed before storage and cannot be recovered. Store it as an environment variable immediately.
</Note>

## 2. Verify Your First Agent Action

When an AI agent requests to perform an action on your platform, verify it before processing:

<CodeGroup title="Verify an agent action">

```ts
const response = await fetch('https://api.procta.org/v1/verify', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.PROCTA_RP_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    kya_id: 'kya_abc123def456',
    action: 'payments:send',
    amount: '500.00',
    asset: 'USD',
  }),
})
const result = await response.json()

if (result.decision === 'ALLOWED') {
  // Safe to process the transaction
} else {
  // Deny — result.reason explains why
  console.log(`Denied: ${result.reason}`)
}
```

```python
import os, requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.procta.org/v1/verify",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['PROCTA_RP_KEY']}"},
    json={
        "kya_id": "kya_abc123def456",
        "action": "payments:send",
        "amount": "500.00",
        "asset": "USD",
    },
)
result = response.json()

if result["decision"] == "ALLOWED":
    pass  # Safe to process
else:
    print(f"Denied: {result['reason']}")
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_rp_xyz789..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "kya_id": "kya_abc123def456",
    "action": "payments:send",
    "amount": "500.00",
    "asset": "USD"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

Procta checks four things in a single call (typically under 15ms):

1. **Agent status** — Is the agent active?
2. **Owner verification** — Is the agent's owner KYC/KYB-verified?
3. **Scope authorization** — Does the agent have the `payments:send` scope?
4. **Transaction limits** — Is `500.00` within the agent's configured limits?

## 3. Look Up an Agent

Before the first transaction, you can look up an agent's identity and verification status:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/agents/lookup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_rp_xyz789..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "kya_id": "kya_abc123def456" }'
```

```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "agent": {
    "kyaId": "kya_abc123def456",
    "name": "PaymentBot",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "environment": "PRODUCTION"
  },
  "owner": {
    "verificationStatus": "VERIFIED",
    "riskBand": "LOW"
  }
}
```

## 4. Verify a Credential Directly

If an agent presents a Verifiable Credential JWT, you can verify it without an API key:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/credentials/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "vcJwt": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." }'
```
