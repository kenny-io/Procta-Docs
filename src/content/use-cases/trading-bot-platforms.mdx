title: Trading Bot Platforms
description: How automated trading platforms use Procta to verify bot identity, enforce trade scopes, and maintain owner accountability before every order.
---

Automated trading platforms — copy-trading services, algorithmic execution engines, signal-based bots, and portfolio rebalancers — are among the most active deployers of autonomous agents in crypto. These bots place orders, manage positions, cancel trades, and move funds across exchanges, often executing hundreds of actions per minute.

The challenge is straightforward: a trading bot with unrestricted API keys can drain an account in seconds. Platforms have no standardized way to verify that a bot is authorized to trade a specific pair, within a specific size, on behalf of a specific owner. API keys grant access, but they don't carry context about *what* the bot should be allowed to do.

## What goes wrong without verification

When a user connects a trading bot to an exchange or trading platform, the bot typically receives a set of API credentials with broad permissions. There's no mechanism to enforce that the bot only trades spot (not futures), stays within a daily volume cap, or belongs to the account holder who authorized it.

This creates several failure modes:

- A compromised bot executes unauthorized withdrawals using trading credentials
- A misconfigured copy-trading bot exceeds the position size the user intended
- A rogue bot places orders on pairs the user never authorized
- A platform has no way to prove, after the fact, which bot took which action and who authorized it

These aren't edge cases. They're the default behavior when agents operate without identity or scope enforcement.

## How Procta fits into the trading flow

Procta sits between the bot's action request and the platform's execution engine. Before any order is processed, the platform calls Procta to verify the bot's identity, scope, and limits.

The **agent owner** registers on Procta, completes identity verification (KYC for individuals, KYB for organizations), and registers their trading bot with specific scopes like `trading:spot` and a per-transaction limit of $10,000.

Procta issues the bot a unique `kya_` identifier and a W3C-compatible verifiable credential.

When the bot submits an order to the **trading platform**, the platform calls Procta's `/verify` endpoint with the bot's `kya_id`, the action (`trading:spot`), and the order amount.

Procta checks the bot's identity, owner verification status, scope authorization, and transaction limits — then returns `ALLOWED` or `DENIED`.

The platform only executes the order if the decision is `ALLOWED`. Every decision is logged in Procta's immutable audit trail.

<CodeGroup title="Pre-trade verification">

```ts
const response = await fetch('https://api.procta.org/v1/verify', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.PROCTA_RP_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    kya_id: 'kya_01kbot9x3mfq72a0trading',
    action: 'trading:spot',
    amount: '10000.00',
    asset: 'USDC',
  }),
})
const result = await response.json()

if (result.decision === 'ALLOWED') {
  await executeOrder(order)
} else {
  await rejectOrder(order, result.reason)
}
```

```python
import os, requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.procta.org/v1/verify",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['PROCTA_RP_KEY']}"},
    json={
        "kya_id": "kya_01kbot9x3mfq72a0trading",
        "action": "trading:spot",
        "amount": "10000.00",
        "asset": "USDC",
    },
)
result = response.json()

if result["decision"] == "ALLOWED":
    execute_order(order)
else:
    reject_order(order, result["reason"])
```

## What the platform gains

**Scope enforcement.** Each bot is registered with explicit scopes — `trading:spot`, `trading:futures`, `trading:margin` — and per-transaction limits. A bot scoped to spot trading cannot place a futures order, regardless of what API keys it holds.

**Owner accountability.** Every bot traces back to a verified owner through Procta's KYA (Know Your Agent) framework. If a bot misbehaves, the platform can identify the owner, review the audit trail, and take action.

**Compliance-ready audit trail.** Every verification decision — allowed or denied — is logged with the agent identity, action, amount, timestamp, and result. Platforms can export these logs as CSV for regulatory reporting or internal compliance reviews.

**Sub-millisecond overhead.** Procta's verification endpoint is designed for high-frequency use. Typical response times are under 15ms, making it viable even for latency-sensitive trading flows.

## Scopes for trading platforms

Trading platforms typically use scopes like:

| Scope | Allows |
|---|---|
| `trading:spot` | Spot market orders and limit orders |
| `trading:futures` | Futures and perpetual contract orders |
| `trading:margin` | Margin trading and leveraged positions |
| `trading:cancel` | Order cancellation |
| `account:read` | Read-only access to balances and positions |

Scopes are set at agent registration time by the owner and cannot be expanded by the bot itself. See the [Scopes reference](/scopes) for the full list of available scopes.
