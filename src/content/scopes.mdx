title: Scopes
description: Complete reference for all 131 predefined Procta scopes across 24 categories — the permissions that define what an agent is allowed to do.
---

Scopes define what actions an agent is authorized to perform. Every agent is registered with one or more scopes, and every verification request checks the requested action against the agent's scopes.

Procta uses a predefined scope registry — similar to how GitHub defines OAuth scopes. Scopes follow the format `category:action` and are organized into 24 categories covering the full range of crypto and DeFi agent use cases. You can also use category wildcards (`category:*`) to grant all actions within a category.

## How scopes work

1. **At registration** — The owner assigns scopes to the agent when registering it via `POST /v1/owners/:ownerId/agents`
2. **At verification** — The relying party sends the `action` field in the verification request (`POST /v1/verify`), and Procta checks it against the agent's scopes
3. **At update** — Scopes can be modified via `PATCH /v1/agents/:id`, and a new credential should be reissued to reflect the change

Scopes are enforced server-side. An agent cannot expand its own scopes — only the owner can modify them.

## Scope format

```
category:action
```

- **`trading:spot`** — Allows spot trading
- **`trading:*`** — Allows all trading actions
- **`*`** — Allows everything (use with extreme caution)

## Listing available scopes

Use the public API endpoint to list all available scopes:

```bash
curl https://api.procta.org/v1/scopes
```

Or filter by category:

```bash
curl https://api.procta.org/v1/scopes/trading
```

## Scope validation

Procta validates scopes at agent registration and update time. Only predefined scopes, category wildcards, and the global wildcard are accepted. If you pass an invalid scope, the API returns:

```json
{
  "error": "INVALID_SCOPES",
  "message": "Invalid scopes: foo:bar. Use GET /v1/scopes to see all available scopes.",
  "invalidScopes": ["foo:bar"]
}
```

## Example: scoping a trading bot on Binance

```json
{
  "scopes": ["trading:spot", "trading:cancel", "trading:modify", "trading:read", "account:read"],
  "limits": {
    "perTransaction": { "USDT": "5000" },
    "daily": { "USDT": "50000" }
  }
}
```

## Example: scoping a DeFi yield agent

```json
{
  "scopes": [
    "defi:swap", "defi:deposit", "defi:withdraw", "defi:claim",
    "yield:vault-deposit", "yield:vault-withdraw", "yield:harvest", "yield:compound",
    "token:approve", "token:read", "defi:read", "yield:read"
  ],
  "limits": {
    "perTransaction": { "USD": "10000" },
    "daily": { "USD": "100000" }
  }
}
```

## Example: scoping a liquidation keeper

```json
{
  "scopes": ["lending:liquidate", "lending:read", "automation:execute", "automation:trigger"],
  "limits": {
    "perTransaction": { "USD": "50000" }
  }
}
```

## Best practices

- **Principle of least privilege** — Assign the minimum scopes an agent needs. A trading bot that only trades spot doesn't need `trading:*`.
- **Separate withdrawal authority** — Never combine trading and withdrawal scopes on the same agent unless absolutely necessary. Use dedicated withdrawal agents with stricter limits.
- **Use read scopes** — Every category has a `:read` scope. Use it for monitoring and reporting agents that don't need write access.
- **Avoid the global wildcard** — The `*` scope grants unrestricted access. Use it only for development and testing, never in production.
- **Combine scopes with limits** — Scopes define *what* an agent can do. Limits define *how much*. Always pair scopes with appropriate per-transaction and daily limits.
- **Split DeFi concerns** — Use `defi:*` for general DEX interactions, `lending:*` for lending-specific operations, and `yield:*` for vault/farming strategies. This gives you fine-grained control over what a DeFi agent can touch.
- **Be specific with wallet signing** — Prefer `wallet:sign-transfer` over `wallet:sign-contract` when possible. The more specific the signing scope, the smaller the blast radius if the agent is compromised.
