title: Introduction
description: Procta is the trust and attestation layer for autonomous agents operating in financial and regulatory environments.
---

Procta provides **Know Your Agent (KYA)** identity, verifiable credentials, real-time verification, and a full audit trail for AI agents operating in financial and regulatory environments.

## What Procta does

- **KYA Identity** — Every agent receives a unique `kya_` identifier tied to a verified owner
- **Verifiable Credentials** — W3C-compatible JWT credentials issued at agent registration
- **Real-time Verification** — Sub-millisecond scope and limit checks before every transaction
- **Audit Trail** — Immutable log of every verification decision with CSV export

## Who uses Procta

### Agent Owners

Organizations or individuals who deploy autonomous financial agents. Owners register on Procta, complete identity verification (KYC for individuals, KYB document submission for organizations), then register their agents with specific scopes and transaction limits. See the [Owner Guide](/guides/owner-guide).

### Relying Parties (Integrators)

Platforms, exchanges, and financial services that interact with AI agents. Relying parties use Procta's verification API to confirm an agent's identity, authorization scope, and transaction limits before processing requests. See the [Quickstart](/quickstart) to start verifying agents in under 5 minutes.

<Note type="info" title="Base URL">
All API requests use `https://api.procta.org/v1` as the base URL. See the [API Reference](/api/reference) for the full endpoint list.

## How it works

<CodeGroup title="Verify an agent action">

```ts
const response = await fetch('https://api.procta.org/v1/verify', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.PROCTA_RP_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    kya_id: 'kya_abc123def456',
    action: 'payments:send',
    amount: '500.00',
    asset: 'USD',
  }),
})
const result = await response.json()
// { decision: "ALLOWED", agent: {...}, latencyMs: 12 }
```

```python
import os
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.procta.org/v1/verify",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['PROCTA_RP_KEY']}"},
    json={
        "kya_id": "kya_abc123def456",
        "action": "payments:send",
        "amount": "500.00",
        "asset": "USD",
    },
)
print(response.json())
# {"decision": "ALLOWED", "agent": {...}, "latencyMs": 12}
```
