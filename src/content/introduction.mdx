title: Introduction
description: Procta is the trust and attestation layer for autonomous financial agents.
---

Procta provides **Know Your Agent (KYA)** identity, verifiable credentials, real-time verification, and a full audit trail for AI agents operating in financial environments.

## What Procta does

- **KYA Identity** — Every agent receives a unique `kya_` identifier tied to a verified owner
- **Verifiable Credentials** — W3C-compatible JWT credentials issued at agent registration
- **Real-time Verification** — Sub-millisecond scope and limit checks before every transaction
- **Audit Trail** — Immutable log of every verification decision with CSV export

## Who uses Procta

### Agent Owners

Organizations or individuals who deploy autonomous financial agents. Owners register on Procta, complete KYC verification, then register their agents with specific scopes and transaction limits.

### Relying Parties

Platforms, exchanges, and financial services that interact with AI agents. Relying parties use Procta's verification API to confirm an agent's identity, authorization scope, and transaction limits before processing requests.

## How it works

<CodeGroup title="Verify an agent action">

```ts
const response = await fetch('https://api.procta.org/v1/verify', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.PROCTA_RP_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    kya_id: 'kya_abc123def456',
    action: 'payments:send',
    amount: '500.00',
    asset: 'USD',
  }),
})
const result = await response.json()
// { decision: "ALLOWED", agent: {...}, latencyMs: 12 }
```

```python
import os
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.procta.org/v1/verify",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['PROCTA_RP_KEY']}"},
    json={
        "kya_id": "kya_abc123def456",
        "action": "payments:send",
        "amount": "500.00",
        "asset": "USD",
    },
)
print(response.json())
# {"decision": "ALLOWED", "agent": {...}, "latencyMs": 12}
```
