title: Getting Started with Dox
description: Set up Dox and create your first documentation page in under five minutes.
---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** and npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- A terminal and code editor
- An OpenAPI spec (optional — a Pet Store example is included)

## 1. Clone the template

```bash
npx degit kenny-io/Dox my-docs
cd my-docs
npm install
```

## 2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the default docs site.

## 3. Create your first page

Create a new file at `src/content/my-first-page.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: My First Page
description: A quick test page to verify everything works.
---

Welcome to my documentation! This page was created with Dox.

## Next steps

- Edit `docs.json` to add this page to the sidebar.
- Replace the example content with your own.
```

## 4. Add it to the navigation

Open `docs.json` and add your page to a group:

```json
{
  "group": "Getting Started",
  "pages": ["introduction", "quickstart", "my-first-page"]
}
```

Save the file and the sidebar updates automatically.

## 5. Deploy

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy the output to any platform that supports Next.js — Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, or a Docker container.
