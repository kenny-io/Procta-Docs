## MDX basics

Every page in Dox is an `.mdx` file — Markdown with JSX support. You can use standard Markdown syntax plus React components inline.

```mdx
# Heading

Regular paragraph with **bold**, *italic*, and `inline code`.

- Bullet lists
- Work as expected

1. Numbered lists too
```

## Frontmatter

Every page needs a frontmatter block at the top:

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: A short summary for search results and meta tags.
---
```

| Field | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | Yes | Page heading and sidebar label |
| `description` | Yes | Meta description and search snippet |

The title from frontmatter is automatically rendered as the page heading — you don't need to add an `# H1` in the body.

## Code blocks

Fenced code blocks get syntax highlighting automatically:

````mdx
```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello from Dox!'
console.log(greeting)
```
````

Use the `bash`, `typescript`, `python`, `json`, or any other language identifier supported by Shiki.

## Callouts and notes

Use the `<Note>` component to highlight important information:

```mdx
<Note type="info" title="Good to know">
  Notes support **Markdown** inside them.
</Note>

<Note type="warning" title="Heads up">
  This is a warning callout.
</Note>
```

Available types: `info`, `warning`, `danger`, `tip`.

## Links

Standard Markdown links work for both internal and external pages:

```mdx
Check the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide or visit [GitHub](https://github.com).
```

## Images

Place images in the `public/` folder and reference them with a leading slash:

```mdx
![Architecture diagram](/images/architecture.png)
```

## Tables

Standard Markdown tables render with proper styling:

```mdx
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /pets | List all pets |
| POST | /pets | Create a pet |
```

## File organization

All content lives in `src/content/`. You can use subdirectories to organize related pages:

```
src/content/
  introduction.mdx          → /introduction (or / for the root)
  quickstart.mdx             → /quickstart
  guides/
    getting-started.mdx      → /guides/getting-started
    writing-content.mdx      → /guides/writing-content
```

The URL path matches the file path relative to `src/content/`, minus the `.mdx` extension.
