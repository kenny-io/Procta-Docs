description: How to connect your OpenAPI spec and customize the auto-generated API reference.

## Adding your spec

Place your OpenAPI 3.x spec file in the project root as `openapi.yaml` (or `openapi.json`). Then configure it in `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "tab": "API Reference",
  "api": {
    "source": "openapi.yaml",
    "tagsOrder": ["Users", "Orders", "Products"],
    "defaultGroup": "General"
  }
}
```

The API Reference tab will auto-generate a page for every operation in your spec.

## Configuration options

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | Yes | Path to your OpenAPI spec file, relative to the project root. |
| `tagsOrder` | No | Controls the order tags appear in the sidebar. Unlisted tags appear after. |
| `defaultGroup` | No | Group name for operations without tags. Defaults to `"General"`. |
| `overrides` | No | Per-operation customizations (see below). |

## Operation overrides

You can customize how individual operations appear in the sidebar and docs:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "source": "openapi.yaml",
    "overrides": {
      "GET /users": {
        "title": "List users",
        "description": "Fetch all users with pagination.",
        "badge": "Stable"
      },
      "DELETE /users/{id}": {
        "title": "Delete user",
        "badge": "Destructive"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The key format is `METHOD /path` — matching the `method` and `path` from your OpenAPI spec.

Available override fields:

- **`title`** — custom sidebar and page title
- **`description`** — custom description shown below the title
- **`badge`** — a label displayed next to the operation title
- **`group`** — move the operation to a different sidebar group

## Tag ordering

By default, operations are grouped by their OpenAPI `tags`. The `tagsOrder` array controls the sidebar order:

```json
"tagsOrder": ["Authentication", "Users", "Orders"]
```

Tags not listed in `tagsOrder` appear after the listed ones, in the order they first appear in the spec.

## Try It panel

Every API operation page includes a "Try It" button that opens an interactive request panel. It:

- Prefills parameters from the OpenAPI schema
- Sends requests through a server-side proxy to avoid CORS issues
- Displays the response with status code, headers, and body
- Generates a cURL command you can copy

No configuration needed — it works automatically from your spec.

## Replacing the example spec

The template ships with a Pet Store example. To use your own API:

1. Replace `openapi.yaml` with your spec
2. Update the `tagsOrder` in `docs.json` to match your tags
3. Add any `overrides` you want
4. Run `npm run dev` to see the result
