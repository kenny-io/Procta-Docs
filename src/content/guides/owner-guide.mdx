---

This guide walks you through the complete lifecycle of an agent owner on Procta, from registration to managing your AI agents.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create Your Owner Account">

1. Visit the [Procta owner registration page](https://procta.org/register/owner)
2. Select your **Owner Type**:
   - **Individual** — For personal AI agents
   - **Organization** — For business-deployed agents (requires KYB documents)
3. Fill in the required details:
   - **Email address** — Used for login and notifications
   - **Password** — Secure password for dashboard access
   - **Jurisdiction** — Your country (for regulatory context)
4. Click **Create Account**

You'll receive:
- An **Owner ID** for your account
- A **one-time API key** (starts with `prc_owner_`) — save this immediately

<Note type="danger" title="Save your API key immediately">
The API key is shown only once and cannot be recovered. Store it securely in a secrets manager or environment variable.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Verify Your Email">

Before you can log in, you must verify your email address:

1. Check your email for a 6-digit verification code from Procta
2. Enter the code on the verification screen, or use the API:

```bash
# Request a new code (if needed)
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/auth/email-verification/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."

# Submit the code
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/auth/email-verification/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "code": "123456" }'
```

3. Once verified, you can log in at [procta.org/login](https://procta.org/login)

</Step>

<Step title="Complete Identity Verification">

Your verification path depends on your owner type:

**Individual Owners — KYC via Dashboard**

1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Navigate to **Identity Verification** in the sidebar
3. Click **Start KYC Verification**
4. Complete the Sumsub identity flow (takes 2-3 minutes):
   - Upload government-issued ID
   - Take a selfie for liveness check
   - Wait for automatic verification

Status updates automatically — refresh the page to see changes.

**Organization Owners — KYB Document Submission**

1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Navigate to **Identity Verification**
3. Click **Submit KYB Documents**
4. Fill in the required fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Business Name** | Legal business name |
| **Registration Number** | Company registration/incorporation number |
| **Business Document** | Upload registration certificate (PDF or image) |
| **Website** | Company website URL |
| **CEO/Founder Name** | Full name of the CEO or founder |
| **CEO/Founder Email** | Contact email for the CEO |
| **CEO LinkedIn** | LinkedIn profile URL for verification |

5. Click **Submit for Review**

<Note type="info" title="Agent limit while pending">
Organization owners can create up to **1 agent** while KYB is under review. Once verified, the limit is removed.
</Note>

Or submit via API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/kyb \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "businessName": "Acme Corp",
    "registrationNumber": "RC-123456",
    "businessDocUrl": "https://uploads.example.com/doc.pdf",
    "website": "https://acme.com",
    "ceoName": "Jane Doe",
    "ceoEmail": "jane@acme.com",
    "ceoLinkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe"
  }'
```

**Verification Statuses**

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `PENDING` | Verification not yet started |
| `PENDING_REVIEW` | KYB submitted, awaiting admin review (org owners only) |
| `IN_REVIEW` | KYC submitted, under review by Sumsub |
| `VERIFIED` | Identity confirmed — full access to register agents |
| `REJECTED` | Verification failed — contact support |

Check your status in the dashboard or via API:

```bash
curl https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/kyc-status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."
```

</Step>

<Step title="Register Your First Agent">

Once verified (or with the 1-agent limit for pending organizations):

1. In the dashboard, go to **Agents** in the sidebar
2. Click **Register New Agent**
3. Fill in the agent details:
   - **Name** — A friendly name for the agent (e.g., "PaymentBot")
   - **Description** — What this agent does
   - **Scopes** — Actions the agent can perform (e.g., `payments:send`, `trading:execute`)
   - **Limits** — Transaction limits (per transaction and daily)
   - **Environment** — `SANDBOX` for testing, `PRODUCTION` for live use
   - **Profile Image** — Optional agent avatar
4. Click **Register Agent**

Each agent receives:
- A unique **KYA ID** (e.g., `kya_01khm4wne0d583nsxgzgs14ej0`)
- A **Verifiable Credential JWT** — share this with relying parties

Or register via API:

```ts
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/${ownerId}/agents`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${ownerApiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'PaymentBot',
      description: 'Handles outbound payments',
      scopes: ['payments:send', 'payments:receive'],
      limits: { perTransaction: '1000', dailyLimit: '10000' },
      environment: 'SANDBOX',
    }),
  }
)
const { agent, vcJwt } = await response.json()
```

</Step>

<Step title="Manage Your Agents">

From the dashboard **Agents** section:

1. **View all agents** — See KYA IDs, statuses, scopes, and limits at a glance
2. **Edit agent** — Update name, description, scopes, or limits
3. **Suspend agent** — Temporarily disable an agent (status changes to `SUSPENDED`)
4. **Reinstate agent** — Reactivate a suspended agent
5. **Revoke agent** — Permanently disable an agent (status changes to `REVOKED`)

Agent statuses:
- `ACTIVE` — Agent can perform actions
- `SUSPENDED` — Temporarily paused (can be reinstated)
- `REVOKED` — Permanently disabled (cannot be reinstated)

</Step>

<Step title="Manage API Keys">

From the dashboard **API Keys** section:

1. **View keys** — See all your API keys (only prefixes shown for security)
2. **Generate new key** — Click "Create New Key" for rotation or different use cases
3. **Revoke key** — Immediately invalidate a compromised key

Or manage via API:

```bash
# List your API keys
curl https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."

# Create a new key
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."

# Revoke a key
curl -X DELETE https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/api-keys/{keyId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."
```

</Step>

<Step title="View Audit Logs">

From the dashboard **Audit Logs** section:

1. See all verification events for your agents
2. Filter by agent, date range, or decision
3. Export logs to CSV for compliance reporting

Or query via API:

```bash
curl "https://api.procta.org/v1/audit?agentId={agentId}&limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."
```

</Step>

</Steps>
