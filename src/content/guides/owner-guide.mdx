This guide walks through the full lifecycle of an agent owner on Procta, from registration to managing a fleet of AI agents.

## Register as an Owner

Create your owner account with your organization details:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/owners \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ownerType": "ORGANIZATION",
    "email": "admin@yourcompany.com",
    "password": "secure-password-here",
    "jurisdiction": "US"
  }'
```

You'll receive:
- **Owner profile** with a `PENDING` verification status
- **One-time API key** prefixed with `prc_owner_`
- **KYC URL** to complete identity verification

<Note type="danger" title="Save your API key immediately">
The API key is shown only once. Store it in a secure vault — it cannot be recovered.
</Note>

## Complete KYC Verification

Visit the `kycUrl` returned at registration to complete identity verification through Sumsub. The process typically takes a few minutes.

Your `verificationStatus` will progress through:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PENDING` | KYC not yet started |
| `IN_REVIEW` | KYC submitted, under review |
| `VERIFIED` | Identity confirmed — you can register agents |
| `REJECTED` | Verification failed — contact support |

Check your status at any time:

```bash
curl https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/kyc-status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."
```

## Register Agents

Once verified, register agents with specific scopes and transaction limits:

```ts
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/${ownerId}/agents`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${ownerApiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'PaymentBot',
      description: 'Handles outbound payments',
      scopes: ['payments:send', 'payments:receive'],
      limits: { perTransaction: '1000', dailyLimit: '10000' },
      environment: 'SANDBOX',
    }),
  }
)
const { agent, vcJwt } = await response.json()
```

Each agent receives:
- A unique **KYA ID** (e.g., `kya_abc123def456`)
- A **Verifiable Credential JWT** binding the agent to your verified identity

## Manage API Keys

You can create additional API keys and revoke compromised ones:

```bash
# List your API keys
curl https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."

# Create a new key
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."

# Revoke a key
curl -X DELETE https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/api-keys/{keyId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."
```

## Dashboard Access

Set a password to access the Procta dashboard:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/auth/set-password \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "password": "your-dashboard-password" }'
```

The dashboard provides a visual interface for managing agents, viewing audit logs, and monitoring verification activity.
