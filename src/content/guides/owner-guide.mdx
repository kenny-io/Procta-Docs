This guide walks through the full lifecycle of an agent owner on Procta, from registration to managing a fleet of AI agents.

## Register as an Owner

Create your owner account. Choose `INDIVIDUAL` or `ORGANIZATION` based on your entity type:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/owners \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ownerType": "ORGANIZATION",
    "email": "admin@yourcompany.com",
    "password": "secure-password-here",
    "jurisdiction": "US"
  }'
```

You'll receive:
- **Owner profile** with a `PENDING` verification status
- **One-time API key** prefixed with `prc_owner_`
- **KYC URL** (for individual owners) to complete identity verification

<Note type="danger" title="Save your API key immediately">
The API key is shown only once. Store it in a secure vault — it cannot be recovered.
</Note>

## Verify Your Email

After registration, you must verify your email before you can log in to the dashboard. An OTP code is sent to your email:

```bash
# Request a verification code
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/auth/email-verification/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."

# Submit the 6-digit code
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/auth/email-verification/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "code": "123456" }'
```

## Complete Identity Verification

The verification path depends on your owner type:

### Individual Owners — KYC via Sumsub

Visit the `kycUrl` returned at registration to complete identity verification through Sumsub. The process typically takes a few minutes.

### Organization Owners — KYB Document Submission

Organization owners submit business verification documents through the dashboard or API. Required fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `businessName` | Legal business name |
| `registrationNumber` | Company registration number |
| `businessDocUrl` | URL of uploaded business registration document |
| `website` | Company website URL |
| `ceoName` | CEO/Founder full name |
| `ceoEmail` | CEO/Founder email |
| `ceoLinkedin` | CEO/Founder LinkedIn profile URL |

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/kyb \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "businessName": "Acme Corp",
    "registrationNumber": "RC-123456",
    "businessDocUrl": "https://uploads.example.com/doc.pdf",
    "website": "https://acme.com",
    "ceoName": "Jane Doe",
    "ceoEmail": "jane@acme.com",
    "ceoLinkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe"
  }'
```

<Note type="info" title="Agent limit while pending">
Organization owners can create up to **1 agent** while their KYB is under review. Once verified, the limit is removed.
</Note>

### Verification Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PENDING` | Verification not yet started |
| `PENDING_REVIEW` | KYB documents submitted, awaiting admin review |
| `IN_REVIEW` | KYC submitted to Sumsub, under review |
| `VERIFIED` | Identity confirmed — full access to register agents |
| `REJECTED` | Verification failed — contact support |

Check your status at any time:

```bash
curl https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/kyc-status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."
```

## Register Agents

Once verified (or with 1-agent limit for pending organizations), register agents with specific scopes and transaction limits:

```ts
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/${ownerId}/agents`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${ownerApiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'PaymentBot',
      description: 'Handles outbound payments',
      scopes: ['payments:send', 'payments:receive'],
      limits: { perTransaction: '1000', dailyLimit: '10000' },
      environment: 'SANDBOX',
    }),
  }
)
const { agent, vcJwt } = await response.json()
```

Each agent receives:
- A unique **KYA ID** (e.g., `kya_abc123def456`)
- A **Verifiable Credential JWT** binding the agent to your verified identity

## Manage API Keys

You can create additional API keys and revoke compromised ones:

```bash
# List your API keys
curl https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."

# Create a new key
curl -X POST https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."

# Revoke a key
curl -X DELETE https://api.procta.org/v1/owners/{id}/api-keys/{keyId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer prc_owner_..."
```

## Dashboard Access

The Procta dashboard at [app.procta.org](https://app.procta.org) provides a visual interface for:

- Managing agents (create, suspend, revoke, reinstate)
- Submitting KYB documents for organization verification
- Viewing audit logs and verification activity
- Managing API keys

Log in with the email and password you set during registration.
