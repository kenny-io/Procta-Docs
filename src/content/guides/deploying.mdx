description: Build and deploy your Dox documentation site to any hosting platform.
---

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates an optimized production build in the `.next/` directory. All documentation pages are statically pre-rendered for fast loading.

## Environment variables

Before deploying, set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable to your production domain. This is used for OpenGraph metadata and canonical URLs:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://docs.yourproduct.com
```

## Vercel

The fastest way to deploy — push to GitHub and import the repo:

1. Push your docs repo to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import the repository
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in the environment variables
4. Deploy

Vercel auto-detects Next.js and configures everything.

## Netlify

```bash
npm run build
```

Set the build command to `npm run build` and the publish directory to `.next`. You may need the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin for full Next.js support.

## Docker

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/src/content ./src/content
COPY --from=builder /app/openapi.yaml ./
COPY --from=builder /app/docs.json ./

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-docs .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-docs
```

## Cloudflare Pages

Use the `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` adapter:

1. Install: `npm install @cloudflare/next-on-pages`
2. Set build command: `npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages`
3. Set output directory: `.vercel/output/static`
4. Deploy via the Cloudflare dashboard or Wrangler CLI

## Static export

If you don't need server-side features (like the Try It proxy), you can export as a fully static site. Add to `next.config.ts`:

```ts
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
}
```

Then run `npm run build` — the output will be in the `out/` directory, ready for any static host.

<Note type="warning" title="Static export limitation">
  The API "Try It" panel requires a server-side proxy route and won't work with static export. All other features work fine.
</Note>
